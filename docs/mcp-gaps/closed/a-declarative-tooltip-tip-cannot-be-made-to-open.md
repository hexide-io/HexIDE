# 7. A declarative `ToolTip.Tip` cannot be made to open (narrowed 2026-09-08)

**Was:** *No pointer-hover action — can't trigger a data tip (or any hover) via MCP.* A `hover(target, x?, y?,
dwellMs?)` action now exists and raises real `PointerEntered`/`PointerMoved`, so the editor half of this is
closed. What remains is narrower and has a different cause, so the entry is narrowed rather than archived.

**Symptom.** `hover` reaches anything that opens a tip from its **own** pointer handler, but not a tip Avalonia
manages. Measured against the running IDE:

| Target | Result |
|---|---|
| Code editor over an identifier | `tip: count As Integer` — the LSP quick-info tip, text asserted |
| `Button[Standard.AddForm]`, which carries `ToolTip.Tip` | `no tip opened within 1000ms` |

`ToolTipService` opens a declarative tip in response to `IsPointerOver` changing. That property is set by the
input manager from a real device position; a synthetically raised `PointerEntered` does not set it, and it is
not publicly settable. So the toolbar button's tip cannot be made to appear at all.

**Workaround, and it is deliberately not a fix.** When nothing opens, `hover` reports what the control
*declares* — `declared tip: Add Form` — read straight off the attached property. That answers the question a
caller usually has (*has this button the right tooltip?*) without pretending a popup appeared: an observed tip
is reported as `tip:` and a declared one as `declared tip:`, and the two are never merged. Asserting the tip's
**existence on screen**, or its placement, is still out of reach for this case.

**Two further measurements worth keeping.**

- **A synthetic tip opens at the REAL pointer, wherever it last was over this window.**
  `CodeEditorView.axaml.cs:219` sets `ToolTip.SetPlacement(TextEditor, PlacementMode.Pointer)`, so Avalonia
  anchors the popup to the pointer position **it** tracks for that `TopLevel` — and a synthetically raised
  `PointerMoved` does not update that. The position is also *per window* and *sticky*: it holds the last place
  a real pointer crossed this window, so it stays stale while the pointer is over some other application.

  **Measured, not inferred — twice, with the prediction written down first each time.**

  1. *Does it follow the real pointer?* The pointer was parked over the Toolbox strip, far from the
     identifier, and `hover` fired at the caret — reported as `(176.1, 61.8)` inside the editor. The tip
     opened against the left edge beside the Toolbox: at the pointer, not at the caret, not at the origin.
  2. *Is the resting default the screen origin or the window's client origin?* A freshly launched IDE that no
     pointer had ever crossed, pinned to screen `(300, 250)` at 900×600, with the real pointer held on the
     taskbar where even a maximised window cannot reach it. The tip opened at screen `(0, 15)` — well outside
     the window. Client-relative would have put it at roughly `(300, 280)`. **The default is the screen
     origin.**

  3. *Does it survive the pointer leaving?* The pointer was walked from the taskbar up into the window, over
     the editor, and back out through the bottom edge at y≈850, then left outside. The tip still opened
     inside the window rather than reverting to `(0, 15)`. **The position persists after the pointer
     exits** — it is a last-known value, not a live one.

  **One part of that third run resists explanation, and is left that way.** The tip's **x** matched the exit
  point exactly; its **y** did not — it appeared near the *top* of the window, just below the toolbar, having
  exited at the *bottom*. Two candidate rules were considered and neither survives arithmetic: excluding the
  menu/toolbar chrome from the client area shifts the anchor **down**, not up, and clamping to the placement
  target's bounds would pin it to the editor's **bottom** edge. So: measured, reproducible in its x, and no
  vertical rule worth defending. It does not change what a caller should do, because the conclusion below
  never depended on the position being predictable — only on its not being controllable.

  3. *Does it survive the pointer leaving?* The pointer was walked from the taskbar up into the window, over
     the editor, and out again through the **top** edge, then left outside. The tip opened at that exit
     point — just below the toolbar — rather than reverting to `(0, 15)`. **The position persists after the
     pointer exits:** it is a last-known value, not a live one, which is why a window the pointer left
     minutes ago still places its tip where the pointer used to be.

  That run also settles a fair question — whether the menu bar and toolbars count as "client area" for this.
  They do, and no special case is needed: they are ordinary controls in the same `TopLevel`, so passing over
  them updates the tracked position like anywhere else. The tip landing *just below* the toolbar is the same
  constant nudge measured in run 2 — the anchor was on the toolbar, and the tip drew beneath it.

  Every earlier sighting fits the same rule, and each had looked like a different phenomenon:

  | Where the tip appeared | Where the real pointer had last crossed the window |
  |---|---|
  | At the caret — correct, by coincidence | the editor, where the maintainer had been clicking |
  | Just below the screen origin | nowhere: freshly relaunched, never crossed |
  | Over the status bar | near the window's bottom edge |
  | Bottom-left, while the pointer sat top-right | over the terminal, so HexIDE's tracked position was stale |

  **The small drop below `(0, 0)` is the tooltip's own offset, not the title bar.** It looked like title-bar
  height on a maximised window, which is a good guess and was worth testing — but the same ~15 px appeared
  with the window at `(300, 250)`, whose title bar sits at y≈250. It is the ordinary nudge that keeps a tip
  clear of the cursor, and it is constant.

  **Two earlier readings were wrong, and are kept because the next person will make them too.** First "an
  arbitrary position" — it is not arbitrary, it is anchored to something, just not to anything the *call*
  controls. Then "always the screen origin", asserted from two samples that happened to agree; a third
  sighting refuted it, and the origin turned out to be merely the default for a window no pointer had entered.
  A rule drawn from two agreeing measurements is a guess wearing a measurement's clothes.

  **Consequence for a caller, unchanged by the explanation:** `hover` makes a tip's **text** assertable and its
  **position** meaningless, because the position is set by a pointer no automated caller has. Assert the
  reported string; never snapshot the tip.

  **Rejected:** having `hover` impose a deterministic placement (a `PlacementRect` at the hover point) so the
  tip lands where it was asked for. It would make a snapshot *look* right while showing the tip somewhere no
  real user would ever see it — trading an honest limitation for a misleading picture.

- **A synthetic tip is transient.** Without `IsPointerOver` the tip closes again shortly after opening, which
  is why `hover` polls for it rather than looking once when the dwell expires. Sampling once reported "no tip"
  for a tip plainly visible on screen.

**The debugger's Auto Data Tips — the case this gap was filed for (P6c) — are now MEASURED and work.**
Paused at a breakpoint with `total = 42` in scope, `hover` on the identifier returns `tip: total = 42`,
confirmed on screen at the same moment. It took closing gap 4 to get there: while a program is paused the
frontmost window is the program's form, so until `window: "ide"` existed there was no path to aim at the
editor.

*Two issues were opened against this line and both are resolved, one of them wrongly filed:*
hexide-io/HexIDE#334 was real and is fixed (MCP writes saved the previous content and reported success);
**#335 was not a defect** — breakpoints in `Form_Load` work, and the report was an artefact of #334
corrupting the project under test. A negative observation made while another defect is active is not
evidence, which is the part worth keeping.

**A stale-tip bug fell out of this measurement, and is fixed.** Hovering `Debug.Print` right after hovering
`total` reported `declared tip: total = 42` — a wrong answer, not a missing one. The editor closed its tip
with `SetIsOpen(false)` and left `ToolTip.Tip` attached, so the control kept advertising the previous
identifier's value. This tip is *dynamic*, rebuilt per hover, unlike the static tips that property is meant
for. Closing now clears it (`CodeEditorView.CloseTip`), which also removes the live-user hazard: a real
pointer could be shown the previous word's value before the replacement evaluation returned.

**What remains open here is only the declarative case** — a toolbar button's `ToolTip.Tip` still cannot be
made to appear, for the `IsPointerOver` reason above.

**Fix consideration.** Nothing cheap. `IsPointerOver` has no public setter, so short of Avalonia exposing one
— or a real platform-level pointer injection, which is a much larger tool — the declarative case stays out of
reach. Calling `ToolTip.SetIsOpen(control, true)` directly would make the popup appear, and was rejected: it
would report a tip for a control that a real hover might never show one for, which is a false green of exactly
the kind this document exists to prevent.

**Re-read on 2026-10-20, at 4789f9a on Avalonia 12.0.4: still open, and a route may exist.** `hover` still raises
`PointerEntered` and `PointerMoved` on the element (`UiAutomationDriver.Hover`). Avalonia 12.0.4's `ToolTipService`
is internal and handles raw input as the input manager processes it (it declares
`InputManager_OnProcess(RawInputEventArgs)`, read by reflection), which an event raised on the element never passes
through, so the conclusion above holds whatever drives `IsPointerOver`. A window can be handed raw input:
`TopLevel.PlatformImpl.Input` is public, though marked unstable, and takes a `RawPointerEventArgs`, whose public
constructor needs the window's input root. In 12.0.4 that root is the non-public `TopLevel.InputRoot`, reachable only
by reflection, as `close` already reaches the window's own close handling. Not tried.

> **Fixed (#1265), measured headless; the live run is [#1303](https://github.com/hexide-io/HexIDE/issues/1303).** `hover`
